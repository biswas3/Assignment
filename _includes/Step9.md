9. Invite users to your account

You're ready to invite users to your account and grant them access based on the resources they will work with and the tasks they'll perform. If you want users to create resources from the catalog and assign the resources to a resource group, the following access is required:

- Viewer role or higher on the resource group.

- Editor or administrator role on the service.

Complete the following steps:

	1. Go to **Manage > Access (IAM) > Users**.

	2. Click **Invite users**.

	3. Specify the email address of the user. If you are inviting more than one user, they are all assigned the same access.

	4. Add the user to one or more of the access groups that you created in the previous step.

	5. Click **Invite**.
