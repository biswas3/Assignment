7. Create your resource groups

	Resource groups provide a way for you to easily manage access to multiple resources and to view billing usage for a set of resources. With your Pay-As-You-Go account, you can create more resource groups in addition to the default resource group that's included when you first created your Lite account.

 1. Go to **Manage > Account > Account resources > Resource groups**.


1. Click **Create**.


1. Enter a name for your resource group, and click **Add**.
